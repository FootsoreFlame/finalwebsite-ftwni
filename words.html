        <h2>personally, i see expressing gratitude as one
            of the main principles to establishing a positive
            and harmonious connection with others. when we
            express gratitude, we acknowledge the efforts,
            kindness, or support provided by someone else.
            this not only fosters a sense of appreciation
            but also strengthens the bonds between
            individuals. gratitude creates a positive
            atmosphere, promotes empathy, and encourages a
            culture of mutual respect. it serves as a
            foundation for building meaningful relationships,
            whether in personal or professional settings. 


            another benefit of expressing gratitude is that
            it will quite literally make you a better person,
            in all aspects. not only will you feel happier
            and gain a more positive view on life, your
            emotional and mental health will increase. as
            well as this, you will become a better student.
            according to an article by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2414478"><span class="highlight-text">harvard business school</span></a>,
            it was discovered that using journaling can
            increase your productivity by up to 22.8%.
            journaling is something super simple to get into
            the habit of doing and with those type of results
            there is little reason to not want to. of course,
            just because i tell you doesn't mean you will. if
            we are being honest with ourselves, you will
            forget all about this website in 10 minutes time.
            this advice is only for those who need it. those
            who want it. those who are willing to sacrifice
            and do the hard things right now so that their
            future are brighter. what is scrolling for 2 hours
            on instagram going to do for your future? journaling
            is an important tool that you can use in order
            for you to write down and organize your thoughts.
            you can also use this tool to, you guessed it,
            express gratitude for things.  

            i began journaling in late december of 2023.
            i think i initially started gratitude journaling
            in order to heal myself emotionally. during
            this time i was confused. clouded by thoughts.
            i used journaling as a healthy outlet to express
            my thoughts. i have been using this tool ever
            since as a way to lay out my thoughts. i have
            written all sorts of things inside of this journal.
            goals. questions. reflecting on life. i find it
            easier to plan out my goals by writing them
            down. this way, there is no what ifs or hoping
            for something to happen. everything i plan to do
            is imperative to accomplishing my goal. after
            about a week of staying consistent with this
            habit, i noticed a stark contrast from how i was
            feeling and how others saw me. i felt an almost
            immediate relief from my worries and problems.
            others also noted how i looked happier and more
            positive, an aspect of myself that i try to
            influence onto others.
