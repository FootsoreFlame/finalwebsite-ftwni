        <h1>hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <h2>hey. welcome to my website. if it looks kinda bad, just know 
            that this is my first experience working on my own when it
            comes to web development. thatâ€™s not what is important right
            now though. you came here because you were interested in
            what this website had to show you. well, to summarize, in 
            november of 2023, i started to focus on bettering myself to 
            impress someone. even after i got over that someone, i 
            continued to work on myself for my own sake. i didnâ€™t only 
            feel better, but i noticed a large improvement in how others
            saw me as well. so, here is a little bit of my mind. hopefully
            you take something away from what i have to tell you.

            before i forget, this website is dedicated to my family and 
            friends who has always supported me in my endeavors, even 
            when i lacked the capability to reciprocate this support. love.
