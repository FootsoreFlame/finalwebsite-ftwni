        <h3>impact of music</h3>
        <h2>‚Äúmusic was my refuge. i could crawl into the space between
            the notes and curl my back to loneliness.‚Äù this is a quote by
            maya angelou, and i personally relate with sentiment deeply.
            for me, music has been more than just a series of notes and
            some words. it has been a refuge from the solitude that
            sometimes weighs heavy on the soul. like angelou, i
            understand the power of music to envelop me in its embrace,
            allowing me to momentarily forget the loneliness that may
            surround me. i think that growing up a single child has
            made me mature faster through childhood. i had no one to
            share that childhood innocence with. no person to fight with.
            no person to be with when i was feeling lonely. no person to
            tell how my day has been.

            quick tangent but in retrospective, having an intimate
            relationship with someone is somewhat similar to having a
            sibling. having a healthy relationship should feel like they
            are family. someone you can trust and tease at the same 
            time. many times, when people are just getting to know
            each other they find each other to be perfect. this is called
            the honeymoon stage. however, once they get used to each
            other, this is when problems start in the relationship. you
            should feel like your lover is someone you‚Äôve known your
            whole life. someone that you can go through anything with
            no matter what. even if there are problems, you learn to
            get past them and forgive. like siblings. just give it a
            thought. tangent over.

            growing up a single child has honestly made me kind of
            lonely. my parents are good parents. there is no doubt of
            it. however, having just me myself and my thoughts for
            the whole day has made me turn to other forms of comfort.
            primarily, going online and music. i will talk about the 
            internet another time, however for now, i will focus on
            the impact music has had on my life. to start, i think that
            music is something very influential and has the power to
            bring people together. it can induce feeling, emotions,
            make you feel things. a tool used by therapists to help
            their clients is called the iso principle. this tool is used to
            induce feelings to a client through music. to use the iso
            principle, you first start with something calming, more
            chill, typically ambient or slow music. then, you gradually
            switch to something more upbeat. if you apply this logic to
            yourself, you can see how playing the same music that you
            pair with anger or sadness over and over can thus make you
            feel those emotions. i personally use this method to increase
            my productivity and attentiveness whenever i study. i often
            use soft and melodic music (typically lofi or alternative) in
            the background whenever i study to help me focus. another
            way to use this principle effectively that i personally don't
            use but i know works is to music playlist that gradually
            moves from uncomfortable emotions to comfortable ones. this
            can be a healthy coping strategy and facilitate a positive
            mood change. 

            another aspect of music is how it can be connected to certain
            times or places in your life. for example, lets say you get
            into a relationship. on your first date, you guys play this one
            song. from that point on, whenever you hear that song, you
            will remember that moment of you two, together, happy.
            however, all good things come to an end. you two end up
            breaking up and from that point onwards, that song will only
            remind you of loss and regret. this song can have both a
            negative and positive feeling attached to it depending on
            what significance is related to that song. music has the
            remarkable ability to serve as a time capsule, preserving the
            emotions and memories of specific moments in our lives. it 
            becomes a soundtrack to our lives, the connection music and
            our memories is so potent that a single song can transport
            us back to a particular time, evoking the same emotions we
            felt in that moment. 

            i find music to bring me away from the reality of stress and
            anxiety that i often put myself through. it helps me relax and
            calm down to work better. i also find music to be an important
            bond with people. sharing music taste with people i like is
            something i can talk about and having shared interests is
            something i find important when looking for relationships, either
            friendly or intimate. i feel comfortable sharing songs i like with
            others and they should feel the same. music has the power to
            connect people and share emotional connections with them.
