        <h3>mentality</h3>
        <h2>writer's block is real. if i'm being completely transparent, it
            is something i have experienced during the creation of this
            website. i have never been a rather creative person. you would
            think that writing for me would be tough then. well, i actually
            find writing fairly easy and therapeutic. these two traits seem
            rather contradictory. how can someone enjoy writing and struggle
            at it at the same time? for me, i think that the thing which
            helped me realize how to write efficiently was to stop worrying.
            i just write. no overthinking if what i will write is meaningful
            or if people will perceive it well. i just write. having the right
            mindset when it comes to a task can improve your capability of
            completing it tenfold. this same concept can be applied to anything.

            from middle school to late in my first 10th grade semester i
            would say that i was a rather antisocial person. i'd still say that 
            there is a lot of work to do. nobody is perfect. the only difference
            between people that are ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and those who are mediocre is 
            in their ability to acknowledge their flaws and work on them.
            having this kind of mindset is essential to improving as a person.
            you cant change who you are for the better if you can't
            acknowledge how flawed you are, and even then, having the mindset
            of wanting to make a change is another hurdle people struggle
            with. this is one of the main reasons why new year's resolutions
            never work. the average person will acknowledge a flaw they
            have, and make a plan or goal to work on improving that flaw.
            however, they don‚Äôt stick with this goal because they don‚Äôt
            have the right mindset. they are motivated only by the results
            and whenever things get too hard, they give up. this ties into
            the concept of delayed gratification, another important topic
            that is important since everything worth getting is never easy.
            take exercise for example. people start working out often
            with the wrong mindset, expecting immediate and visible
            results. when they don't see rapid changes, they become 
            discouraged and may abandon their fitness goals. 

            the key to personal growth and improvement lies in adopting
            a growth mindset. i‚Äôm sure that this isn‚Äôt anything new. i 
            was taught this concept in 3rd grade and only once i actually
            started to apply this mindset to everything i do in life, i was
            met with success. to briefly explain, growth mindset is having
            a mindset that is open to change and believing that you can
            change as a person. this mindset involves understanding that
            change is a gradual process, and success comes from continuous
            effort and learning from setbacks. it's about embracing challenges,
            persisting through difficulties, and seeing failures as opportunities
            for growth.

            you can even apply this same logic to negative situations. let's 
            say for example that you get a bad grade for an assignment. use 
            this as an experience to learn from your mistakes or reflect and 
            realize that you did bad because you didn‚Äôt study. or even something
            such as switching schools. use this as a chance to meet new people
            and improve your socialization with people you are unfamiliar with.
