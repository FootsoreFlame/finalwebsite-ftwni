        <h2>expressing gratitude</h2>
        <h3>from a young age, we were all asked what we wanted to be when we grow up. most people said astronaut, doctor, firefighter, youtuber. but how many of us actually stuck to that dream? why is that? as we grow older, our understanding of the world expands, and we encounter new interests, challenges, and opportunities. reality often sets in, revealing the complexities and demands of those childhood dreams. we realize that achieving those aspirations requires dedication, hard work, and sometimes sacrifices that not everyone is willing or able to make. moreover, our passions and ambitions evolve over time, shaped by experiences, education, and personal growth. what once seemed like would be the perfect life may no longer resonate with who we are or what we value as adults. life takes us on unexpected paths, leading us to discover new passions, skills, and purposes. the importance of setting these dreams and goals is not in the rigid adherence to them throughout our lives, but rather in the process of exploration, self-discovery, and growth that they inspire. while childhood dreams provide a starting point, they are just that — a starting point. they ignite our imagination, fuel our motivation, and propel us forward, but they are not the endpoint of our journey. the true significance lies in our ability to adapt, to learn from experiences, and to embrace the changes that come our way. setting dreams and goals allows us to chart a course for our lives, but it's the journey itself — the twists and turns, the successes and setbacks — that ultimately shapes who we become.
            for me personally, growing up i wanted to become a youtuber. i know, real original. i thought that since i had the skill it would make me famous. this doesn’t account for the numerous other qualities that are needed to make it big as a youtuber such as personality, editing style, and learning the algorithm. back then, i didn’t have the work ethic and drive that i do now. this led to me quickly falling out of love with content creation. however, in this time that i was interested, i developed important skills that would help me whenever i started to upload again. some of these skills included basic stuff like keywords and hashtags to minor introductions into learning video editing. whenever covid hit the world in 2020, everyone had more time to focus on themselves and their hobbies. most people didn’t take advantage of this but i did. during this time, i picked up content creation again. i started uploading regularly (once a week), and took time to learn important skills like sony vegas pro and photoshop. i started to study the algorithm and learned how to make videos blow up. but even with all this knowledge i still lacked the most important thing that is needed to make it big. the want. i didn’t want this enough, treating this as a mere hobby that i would work on whenever i was bored. thus, i stopped uploading regularly and stopping caring about what i put out. this time was not wasted though. even though all this time invested ultimately led to nothing, i still learned how to video edit and photoshop, which led to me selling my skills online. i would edit videos for people for small amounts of money on the side. it wasn’t much, but it was more than others were doing. the reason i am telling you this is because whenever you set goals, it's crucial to understand not only the skills and knowledge required to achieve them but also the level of dedication and passion needed to see them through, and that not every dream that you give up on is a waste of time. while my initial attempt at content creation lacked the commitment and drive necessary for success, it wasn't a wasted effort. i still learned valuable skills that i would later monetize. 
            furthermore, another aspiration i had growing up was to become a software developer. i quickly learned though that this dream would actually take work and i would have to go out of my way to learn stuff (shocker). i grew to despise learning to code because of how much it frustrated me to learn. to counteract this negative attitude, i combined learning this with something i actually did enjoy. minecraft. i learned to code minecraft hacks and would sell them online. learning how to code this was more fun than tedious and stressful like learning regular coding was. i also made a bit of money on the side which was a bonus. this ultimately led to current day where i am getting back into coding. the moral of this story is that in order to follow your dreams, you first need to learn to love what you do. this sounds really simple, but it is an overlooked aspect of goal setting. let's say you set a goal to do better in school. in order to actually accomplish this goal, you first need to learn to not hate doing your homework and to stop treating it like chore. i'm not saying you need to love homework, but just learn to not do it begrudgingly. this will lead to you doing better and feeling better about doing it. the moral of this story is that you need to learn to love your dream if you actually want to make it a reality. if you find it hard to love your dream, combine aspects of your dream with other things you love to make it more enjoyable. this is one of the main reasons why people are good at certain subjects and suck at others. they have the intrinsic desire for some things and could care less about others. prioritize learning what you want to learn over what you ‘have’ to. for me, although physics is a harder class, i would rather take physics over a chemistry course since i know that i am weaker in science than engineering. keep this attitude with your goals and you will succeed.
